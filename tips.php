                <h3>Summer Lawn Care Tips</h3>
                <p>Keep your lawn healthy during hot summer months by watering deeply but infrequently, mowing at a higher setting, and avoiding fertilization during extreme heat. Early morning watering reduces evaporation and helps prevent fungal diseases.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Water deeply 1-2 times per week rather than daily light watering</li>
                  <li>Raise your mower blade to 3-4 inches during summer heat</li>
                  <li>Water in the early morning (5-9 AM) for best results</li>
                  <li>Avoid fertilizing during periods of extreme heat</li>
                  <li>Leave grass clippings on the lawn to return nutrients to the soil</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Lawn Seeding Success</h3>
                <p>For successful lawn seeding, timing is everything. The best times to seed in our region are late summer to early fall (mid-August to mid-September) or early spring (April to May). Fall seeding is generally more successful as soil is warm, moisture is more consistent, and there's less competition from weeds.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Choose the right seed mix for your sun/shade conditions</li>
                  <li>Prepare soil properly by removing debris and loosening top layer</li>
                  <li>Keep newly seeded areas consistently moist until established</li>
                  <li>Avoid heavy foot traffic on newly seeded areas for 4-6 weeks</li>
                  <li>Consider using a starter fertilizer specifically formulated for new grass</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Natural Pest Control</h3>
                <p>Combat common lawn pests without harsh chemicals by using these natural approaches. A healthy, well-maintained lawn is your first defense against pests and diseases.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Introduce beneficial nematodes to control grubs and other soil-dwelling pests</li>
                  <li>Use corn gluten meal as a natural pre-emergent weed control</li>
                  <li>Spray a mixture of dish soap and water for surface insects like aphids</li>
                  <li>Maintain proper mowing height to discourage weed growth</li>
                  <li>Aerate compacted soil to improve root health and resilience</li>

                <h3>When to Prune Your Hedges</h3>
                <p>Learn the best times of year to prune different types of hedges for optimal growth. Most deciduous hedges should be pruned in late winter while dormant, while spring-flowering shrubs should be pruned immediately after flowering.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Deciduous hedges: Late winter (February-March) when plants are dormant</li>
                  <li>Spring-flowering shrubs: Right after they finish blooming</li>
                  <li>Evergreen hedges: Early spring or mid-summer</li>
                  <li>Avoid pruning in late fall as new growth may not harden before winter</li>
                  <li>Remove dead or diseased branches any time of year</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Proper Pruning Techniques</h3>
                <p>Using the right techniques when pruning ensures plant health and attractive growth. Always use clean, sharp tools and make cuts at the proper angle and location.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Make cuts at a 45-degree angle just above a bud or branch junction</li>
                  <li>Never remove more than one-third of the plant at once</li>
                  <li>Cut back to healthy, outward-facing buds to encourage outward growth</li>
                  <li>Disinfect tools between plants with a 10% bleach solution</li>
                  <li>Prune from the inside out to improve air circulation</li>
                </ul>
